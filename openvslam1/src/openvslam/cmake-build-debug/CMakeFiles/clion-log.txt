CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at /home/nitlab/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/CLion/ch-0/203.7148.70/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:305 (message):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX.so

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.

CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindCXSparse.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "CXSparse",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "CXSparse" with any
  of the following names:

    CXSparseConfig.cmake
    cxsparse-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "CXSparse" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "CXSparse_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "CXSparse" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.


CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:33 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindSuiteSparse.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "SuiteSparse", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SuiteSparse" with
  any of the following names:

    SuiteSparseConfig.cmake
    suitesparse-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SuiteSparse" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SuiteSparse_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "SuiteSparse" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.17)

  should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower
  if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
  information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

-- Configuring done
CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:41 (add_library):
  Policy CMP0028 is not set: Double colon in target name means ALIAS or
  IMPORTED target.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0028" for policy details.
  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Target "Project" links to target "Threads::Threads" but the target was not
  found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an IMPORTED target, or
  an ALIAS target is missing?
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:41 (add_library):
  Policy CMP0003 should be set before this line.  Add code such as

    if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
      cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW)
    endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)

  as early as possible but after the most recent call to
  cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning appears
  because target "Project" links to some libraries for which the linker must
  search:

    Threads::Threads, yaml-cpp, opencv_core, opencv_features2d, opencv_calib3d
    rt

  and other libraries with known full path:

    /usr/local/lib/libg2o_types_sim3.so

  CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
  case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
  compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
  or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for
  more information.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
